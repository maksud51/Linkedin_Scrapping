    "about": "I'm MD. Samiul Islam Sabbir, an Embedded Engineer passionate about transforming innovative ideas into practical and efficient technological solutions. With a strong foundation in electronics, embedded systems, and IoT, I specialize in designing and developing high-performance custom embedded systems tailored to meet demanding real-world requirements. My expertise spans a broad range of microcontrollers, including STM32, ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Atmega32A. From firmware development and RTOS integration to low-power optimization, I bring deep hardware-software integration knowledge to every project. Some of the real-life systems I’ve developed include: Soil Neutrinos Monitoring System – Monitors soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels and sends real-time data to the cloud, empowering precision agriculture. Weather Monitoring System – Captures environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, pressure, rainfall) with live cloud-based reporting. Health Monitoring System – Tracks vital signs like heart rate, temperature, and ECG using wearable IoT-enabled devices. Biogas Monitoring System – Provides real-time monitoring of gas composition, pressure, and safety metrics in biogas facilities. Let’s connect and explore how we can push the boundaries of what's possible in embedded systems and IoT. I'm MD.

Commitment to Excellence:  • Ensured scalability & maintainability of the codebase by refactoring legacy code and adopting modern frontend practices.  • Focused on both new feature implementation & optimization to continuously enhance the web application’s performance.",
