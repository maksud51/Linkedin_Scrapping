    "about": "I hold a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in Finance from Daffodil International University, where I developed a strong foundation in financial management, business strategy, and analytical thinking. Beyond academics, I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of commerce, global trade, and technology—an interest that later guided my career in the garments and export sector. My curiosity about how digital tools can enhance traditional business operations also led me to explore Digital Marketing and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Over the past 15 years, I’ve worked at MBM Garments Ltd. as an Assistant Manager – Commercial, where I gained extensive experience in supply chain management, export documentation, buyer communication, and cost control. Collaborating with international clients, ensuring timely shipments, and maintaining compliance across multiple markets have refined my problem-solving and leadership abilities. Alongside my core responsibilities, I’ve also leveraged digital marketing strategies to strengthen communication and efficiency within business operations. Looking ahead, I aim to broaden my global perspective through further education and international exposure in supply chain and business management. My goal is to combine my industry experience with modern digital strategies to drive organizational growth, operational efficiency, and sustainable trade practices in the evolving global market.
